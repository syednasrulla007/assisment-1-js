    <h3>Q.1): You are provided with two numbers  A and  B. Your task is to add these two numbers.</h3>
   <pre>  const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
    return a + b;
};</pre>

   <h3>Q.2): You are given two number first as A and second as B and check if both conditions (A < 10 and A > B ) are satisfied or not with the help of operators.</h3>
   <pre>const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {
    if(a < 10 && a > b){
      return "true";
    }
    else{
      return "false";
    }
};</pre>

   <h3>  Q.3): You are given two numbers A and B. You need to do the following checks:
    <ol>
        <li>if both are divisible by 10 console true.</li>
        <li>if both are not divisible by 10 console false.</li>
        <li>if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.</li>
    </ol>
    Use operator to do this</h3>
   <pre> const Check = (A, B) => 
    {
        if(A % 10 === 0 || B % 10 === 0) {
            return "true";
          }
          else{
            return "false";
          }
    };</pre>

   <h3>Q.4): You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the first digit of that number.</h3>
   <pre>   const First_Digit = (n) => {
    while (n>=10){
      n = n/10;   
    }
    };</pre>

   <h3>Q.5): You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the last digit of that number.</h3>
   <pre>const Last_Digit = (n) => {
    return n % 10;
};</pre>

   <h3>Q.6): You are provided with two numbers A and B where A as  divisor and B as  dividend.Your task is find the remainder.</h3>
   <pre> const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) => {
    return b % a; 
 };</pre>

   <h3> Q.7): You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to multiply these two numbers.</h3>
   <pre> const Multiply_two_number = (a,b) => {
    return a * b;
  };</pre>

  <h3>  Q.8): Shyam has got his marks in three subjects as A, B, and C (out of 100).Write a program to calculate his total marks and his average.</h3>
  <pre>  const Sum = (A, B, C) => 
    {
      return A + B + C;
    };

    const Average = (A, B, C) => 
    {
     return (A + B + C) / 3;
    };</pre>
